# comments in python is done  through HASH

# name is Rahul
# this is line 1 of address
# this is line 2 of address
# this is line 3 of address
# this is line 4 of address
# pin = 400076

# eg: comment using ''' '''

'''
name is Rahul
this is line 1 of address
this is line 2 of address
this is line 3 of address
this is line 4 of address
pin = 400076
'''


# to ignore new  line i.e enter in the output
student1  = ''' The Students in the class are   as below : \
Rahul  \
Imran  \
Pallavi  '''

# The Students in the class are     Rahul   Imran   Pallavi
print(student1) 

#multi line output using  triple quotes ''' '''

address1 = '''

this is line 2 of address \
this is line 3 of address \
this is line 4 of address \
pin = 400076
