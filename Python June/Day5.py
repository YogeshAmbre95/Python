# to print in tab
student1  = " The Students in the class are  \tRahul \tImran \tPallavi  "
print(student1) # one tab = 4 space

fav1 = " My fav nos are 5\t10\t15\t20\t25"
print(fav1)

# to print in new line 
student1  = " The Students in the class are  \nRahul \nImran \nPallavi  "

# using single quotes ''

print( 'Hello World') #single
print( "Hello World") # double
print( '''Hello World''') # triple

# DOUBLE   quotes ""
# print('Hey , I 'll see you tomorrow')
print("Hey , I 'll see you tomorrow")


# using TRIPLE quotes ''' '''

print('''Ramesh said "I will work hard for the Project''')


# comments in python is done  through HASH
# another way to comment  is through multi line comments using ''''''

# eg :  using hash
# name is Rahul
# this is line 1 of address
# this is line 2 of address
# this is line 3 of address
# this is line 4 of address
# pin = 400076

# eg: comment using ''' '''

'''
name is Rahul
this is line 1 of address
this is line 2 of address
this is line 3 of address
this is line 4 of address
pin = 400076
'''


# to ignore new  line i.e enter in the output
student1  = ''' The Students in the class are   as below : \
Rahul  \
Imran  \
Pallavi  '''

# The Students in the class are     Rahul   Imran   Pallavi
print(student1) 

#multi line output using  triple quotes ''' '''

address1 = '''

this is line 1 of address \
this is line 2 of address \
this is line 3 of address \
this is line 4 of address \
pin = 400076
'''
